# Privacy Policy for HusbandRemote

**Effective date:** February 22, 2026

HusbandRemote (“the App”) helps two partners pair devices and send simple request/response commands.  
This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed when you use the App.

## 1. Information We Process

### 1.1 Information you enter
The App processes:
- Display names you enter (for example wife/husband name).
- Command and response activity (for example request type, status, timestamps).

### 1.2 Optional contact selection
If you use the contact picker to send an invite, the App may access selected contact fields (name, phone number, or email) from your device contacts.

This is used only to prefill the invite flow on your device. The App does not run its own analytics or ad profile based on your contacts.

### 1.3 Purchases
If you buy the one-time Wife Mode unlock, purchase handling is provided by Apple StoreKit.  
The App receives purchase status/entitlement information needed to unlock features.

## 2. Where Data Is Stored and Processed

The App uses Apple services, mainly:
- **CloudKit/iCloud** for pairing records, shared records, command history, and sync.
- **Apple Push Notifications** for command/response notifications.
- **StoreKit** for in-app purchase processing.

The App does not operate its own external backend server for these core features.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use processed data to:
- Create and maintain pairing between two devices.
- Deliver and sync commands/responses.
- Show status/history in the App.
- Enable notifications.
- Validate purchase entitlement for Wife Mode.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We do not sell personal data.

Information is shared only as needed to run the App:
- With your paired partner through CloudKit shared data.
- With Apple services required for iCloud sync, notifications, and in-app purchases.
- If required by law.

## 5. Tracking and Analytics

The App does **not** use third-party advertising SDKs.  
The App does **not** use cross-app tracking for advertising.

## 6. Data Retention and Deletion

Data remains available while your iCloud/CloudKit data for the App exists.

You can remove app data by:
- Using in-app reset/account reset features.
- Deleting app-related CloudKit/iCloud data where supported by Apple.
- Uninstalling the App (local-only data is removed from device storage).

Some synced records may persist in iCloud backups or Apple systems according to Apple’s retention behavior.

## 7. Your Choices

You may choose whether to grant:
- Contacts access (for invite convenience).
- Notification permissions.
- iCloud usage (required for pairing/sync features).

If iCloud is disabled, core pairing/sync functionality may not work.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 9. Security

We rely on Apple platform security, iCloud/CloudKit protections, and standard iOS app sandboxing.  
No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 10. International Processing

Because Apple iCloud/CloudKit services are used, data may be processed in regions where Apple operates infrastructure.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
Updates will be reflected by revising the “Effective date.”
